# python-game
This is a little python game designed in MVC design pattern. I have completed task 1 and the view part of task 2. Feel Free to complete it as your exercise.

To play it, you need to enter `a3_supplied/a3_supplied` and run
```
python a3.py
```
The system required python version is at least 3.10. 

To control whether there is picture in GUI, you can modify the `TASK` variable in `constants.py`. 1 means no picture and 2 means play with picture.

If you want to play with pure logic without GUI, you can run
```
python a2_solution.py
```
